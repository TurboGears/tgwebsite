Getting Started and Documentation Links

The TurboGears documentation is in a state of flux. We have a new book we're working on, and that should be your first stop. It's very light, but includes information on how to get started with TurboGears, and how to contribute.

After that, if your answer is not there, we recommend you check out the older documentation, which has more, but is going to be turned into that book.

To install the current version of TurboGears, please review the 2.2 Installation document.  For doing more, please review the book and then the general index for 2.2 documentation.

 CheatSheet and Poster

We have several older versions of TurboGears, and we continue to support all of them. As such, we also have several older versions of the documentation. While we will eventually reduce the 2.x documentation into a single set, we are not yet ready for this.
