 Genshi, an xml templating engine
##################################

Genshi and Mako are the two top templating languages in the Python web world today. The question of how to choose between them is incredibly difficult, as each serves their role extremely well.

Genshi is an XML based templating engine, and will only serve valid XML/XHTML files. This ensures that your users will always see clean code in their browser.

Genshi is popular, and is used heavily in the Trac issue management system. It's syntax is very straightforward, and it supports inheritance amongst templates.

Using Genshi is always a good choice, and we're proud to offer it as one of the two default templating engines.
