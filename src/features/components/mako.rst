 Mako, a text templating engine
################################

Genshi and Mako are the two top templating languages in the Python web world today. The question of how to choose between them is incredibly difficult, as each serves their role extremely well.

Mako is more similar to the Myghty templating language, or Template::HTML (from the Perl world). This can cause some issues with web designers easily working with the templates, but you gain a serious speed boost from using it.

Mako, like Genshi, is popular. In Mako's case, it is used by default in Pylons.

Like Genshi, using Mako is always a good choice, and we're proud to offer it as one of the two default templating engines.
