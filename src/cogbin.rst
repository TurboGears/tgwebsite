When you quickstart a TurboGears project, the setup.py file already contains the metadata you need. It's just commented out. Choose the right keywords for the kind of project you're releasing, and you're all set.

TurboGears packages added to the `Python Package Index`_ will automatically appear in the CogBin!

The table below has the keywords you should use as well:
