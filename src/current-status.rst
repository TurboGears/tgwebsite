TurboGears was first released in 2005. Due to that age, we actually have two major release versions in production.

TurboGears 1, or TG1 for short, is our legacy version. It is fully supported, and even still being enhanced to allow installation on new versions of Python, and on new OSes. Note that we do not recommend new development occurring on TG1.

TurboGears 2, or TG2 for short, is the current production version. It is being maintained, new features are being added, and we are actively working to make TG2 the best of breed out there. Note that we do recommend all new development occur on TG2.
