TurboGears 2 is a reinvention of the TurboGears project to take advantage of new components, and to provide a fully customizable WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) stack. From the beginning TurboGears was designed to be a Full Stack framework built from best-of-breed components. New components have been released which improved on the ones in the original TGstack, and the Python web world has been increasingly designed around WSGI.

This has enabled a whole new world of reuse, and TG2 is designed to take advantage of this fact in order to make a framework which provides easy to use, productive defaults, while still providing flexibility where it’s useful.

TG2 represents a change from some of the components in TurboGears 1, but we’ve now invested in a set of components that we think will continue to be at the center of python web development for years to come.

********************************************
 A new Generation in dynamic web frameworks
********************************************

TurboGears 2 is the built on top of the experience of several next generation web frameworks including TurboGears 1 (of course), Django, and Rails. All of these frameworks had limitations which were frustrating in various ways, and TG2 is an answer to that frustration. We wanted something that had:

- Real multi-database support
- Horizontal data partitioning (sharding)
- Support for a variety of JavaScript toolkits, and new widget system to make building ajax heavy apps easier
- Support for multiple data-exchange formats.
- Built in extensibility via standard WSGI components

 A framework that helps you get going fast, and gets out of your way when you want it t!

Create a database-driven, ready-to-extend application in minutes. All with designer friendly templates, easy AJAX on the browser side and on the server side, with an incredibly powerful and flexible Object Relational Mapper (ORM), and with code that is as natural as writing a function.
