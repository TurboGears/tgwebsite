Overview
--------

FastData is a TurboGears extension, designed to make fast proto-typing of
administrative interfaces for your data easy by providing a CRUD interface to
Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete instances of your
:doc:`SQLObject </SQLObject/index>` :doc:`data model </GettingStarted/DefineDatabase>`
objects.

Fast Data has two main components:

* :doc:`FastDataGrid </Widgets/DataGrid>` -- a :doc:`TurboGears widget </Widgets/index>` for a grid-like display for your data
  items with action links for adding, changing and deleting items.
* :doc:`DataController <DataController>` -- a controller class taking an SQLObject class and building
  the methods for the CRUD interface.


Usage

Documentation about using or including information on FastData can be found on
the following wiki pages:

* :doc:`DataController <DataController>`
* :doc:`DataGrid </Widgets/DataGrid>` (see section :ref:`fastdata_integration`)
* :doc:`Foreign Keys In FastData <ForeignKeys>`


Installation
------------

FastData is an extension package for TurboGears and therefore needs to be
installed separately. Installable egg files are provided on FastData's `PyPI
page`_, so to download and install FastData, run the following from the command
line::

    [sudo] easy_install TGFastData

If you are installing FastData into the system-wide location for Python packages
(the default with the command above), you will need to obtain root priviledges
by prefixing this command with ``sudo``.


Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FastData is limited in that it only support :doc:`SQLObject </SQLObject/index>`
data models. Support for creating forms for working with :doc:`SQLAlchemy </SQLAlchemy/index>`
model objects is provided by the dbsprockets_ package, which builds on the
:doc:`ToscaWidgets </ToscaWidgets>` project. dbsprockets can be used with TurboGears 2
as well as with TurboGears 1.x but at the moment only supports SQLAlchemy and requires
that you install ToscaWidgets as well.
