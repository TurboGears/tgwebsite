Foreign Keys In Fast Data
=========================

Suppose you have a model that looks like this:

::


    class Employee(SQLObject):
       name = StringCol(length=40, alternateID=True, title="Name")
       department = ForeignKey('Department')

    class Department(SQLObject):
       number = IntCol(alternateID=True, title="Department Number")
       name = StringCol(length=40, alternateID=True, title="Department Name")



If you use FastData to display an Employee's Department in a grid, the Department will show up like this:

::

  <Department number=123, name="Accounting">



What you're seeing is the output from SQLObject's default __str__ method. To make this more readable, override that method:

::


    class Department(SQLObject):
       number = IntCol(alternateID=True, title="Department Number")
       name = StringCol(length=40, alternateID=True, title="Department Name")

       def __str__(self):
          return  "%d(%s)" % (self.number, self.name)



Now, whenever you display the Department as a ForeignKey, you will see:

::

  123 (Accounting)
