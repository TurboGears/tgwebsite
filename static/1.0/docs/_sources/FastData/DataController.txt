DataController
==============

DataController is a main module in :doc:`FastData <index>`.

DataController is a fast method of providing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

You can use this simple function to provide CRUD and customize the DataController's presentation with CSS.


Install TGFastData
------------------

FastData has been split from TurboGears core and is now a plugin.

Before you can take advantage of DataController, you need to install the FastData plugin first.

::

  $ sudo easy_install -f http://www.turbogears.org/download/index.html TGFastData

Use DataController
------------------

controllers.py::

  from turbogears import controllers
  from tgfastdata import DataController
  from model import MyModelClass

  class MyApp(controllers.RootController):
      mycrud = DataController(MyModelClass) # provides a quick
                                            # and dirty CatWalk-like
                                            # CRUD interface for your MyModelClass


Note:

TGFastData is still in development, it currently only supports the
:doc:`SQLObject </SQLObject/index>` database provider.
