Cookie Default

Overview
--------

Sometimes you will want certain page parameters to be saved in a cookie. I've
found this particularly useful for storing filter settings, and I'm sure there
are other uses too.


Usage
-----

The ``cookie_default`` module provides a decorator of the same name for your
controller methods, which can be used like this::

    import cookie_default as cd

    ...

    @tg.expose()
    @cd.cookie_default(areas='All', colors='All', status='Open')
    def mymethod(self, areas, colors, status):
        ...

When the controller method is accessed, if any of the parameters are present in
GET or POST data, their values will be taken from these (and from the defaults
otherwise) and also stored in a cookie. If no parameters are present, they will
be taken from the cookie if present, or the defaults otherwise.

This is a fairly common requirement for me and this module saves me a bit of
typing.
