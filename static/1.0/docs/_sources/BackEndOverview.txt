Overview
========

TurboGears is very flexible with respect to how you can store data persistently. Currently
TurboGears supports the two mayor ORMs available in Python, SQLObject_ (SO) and SQLAlchemy_
(SA). For a comparison between those two with respect to TurboGears, please see :doc:`SQLObject Vs
SQLAlchemy <SQLObject/VsSQLAlchemy>`.

In a default quickstarted project, your `` model.py`` file will only have a few references to
SQLObject, and the identity framework may put some classes in there, but all this can be
manipulated for your needs; if you want, you can even do completely without what TG provides
and write your data access layer.

Supported backends
==================

SQLObject
   is the default for TG 1.0 and every component should work on it, CatWalk, Identity,
   ModelDesigner,etc; For more information about using SQLObject with TurboGears
   see :doc:`SQLObject page <SQLObject/index>`.
SQLAlchemy
   Will be the default in future versions of TurboGears and is currently suported by
   most components. The ones really lacking are development tools like Catwalk and
   ModelDesigner, and of course any third party component/app written on top of SO.
   For a quick introduction of using SA with 1.0 :doc:`follow this link <SQLAlchemy/index>`.
