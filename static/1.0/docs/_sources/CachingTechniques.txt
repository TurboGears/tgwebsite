HTTP Server Cache
-----------------

CherryPy has a `cache filter`_ that implements a HTTP/1.1-compliant
server side cache. You can enable it for your application by setting the
following configuration option in your application's :doc:`config file <Configuration>`
(``app.cfg``)::

    cache_filter.on = True

.. note:: **Side note:** In later CherryPy versions (>= 3.0) the cache
    filter is re-implemented as a tool and the corresponding configuration
    settings group is called ``tools.caching``


Caching Controller Methods
--------------------------

There's a Python Cookbook `caching decorator`_ for caching method calls.


External Cache
--------------

.. index:: memcached

memcached_ is an external process for caching any kind of data. There is a
Python interface available through the python-memcached_ package.
