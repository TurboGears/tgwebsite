The following is a list of ``setuptools`` `entry points`_ used by the
TurboGears framework.

.. _entry points:
    http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#extensible-applications-and-frameworks


paste.paster_create_template
----------------------------

Entry point for TurboGears quickstart templates. Please read how to
create your own quickstart templates on the page about
:doc:`extending quickstart <ExtendingQuickstart>`.


python.templating.engines
-------------------------


.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   TurboKid
   TurboCheetah
   TurboJson

Entry point for Python template engine plugins, like :doc:`/TurboKid`,
:doc:`/TurboCheetah` and :doc:`/TurboJson`. For information on writing a template
engine plugin, see :doc:`Writing a Template Engine <TemplatePlugins>`.


turbogears.command
------------------

This entry point is used for extensions to the ``tg-admin`` utility. The
``tg-admin`` utility expects that the provided object is a class which has a
``desc`` attribute and a ``run()`` method. It can also have an optional
``need_project`` attribute, which if set to True will cause the command to fail
unless it is being run from the root folder of a project. Below is a sample
do-nothing class that correctly implements a tg-admin command.::

    class Sample:
        desc = "This is a sample class which must be run in a project"
        need_project = True
        def __init__(self, version):
            pass

        def run(self):
            pass

Detailed information can be found on the about :doc:`tg-admin Command Plugins <CommandPlugins>`.


turbogears.identity.provider
----------------------------

This entry point is used for extensions to the :doc:`identity <Identity/index>` system.
:doc:`New authentication providers <Identity/Recipes>` can be used to allow authentication against
a variety of sources.


turbogears.extensions
---------------------

This entry point is for TurboGears extension components that hook into the
TurboGears server when it starts up. Examples are the :doc:`visit </Visit/index>`
and :doc:`identity </Identity/index>` frameworks and the TurboMail_ extension.

.. _turbomail: http://www.python-turbomail.org/


turbogears.visit.manager
------------------------

This entry point is used for extensions to the visit system. You can register
a visit manager plugin here, and enable it through the visit configuration.
This allows, for example, to use different storage backends for visit objects
or perform housekeeping tasks, e.g. cleaning up old visits etc.

The visit framework provides its own plugin mechanism for plugins which are
called on every request. See :doc:`Extending the Visit Framework <Visit/Extending>`
for more information.


turbogears.toolboxcommand
-------------------------

The ``turbogears.toolboxcommand`` entry point defines items that are available
on the :doc:`Toolbox <Toolbox>`, the web application that is launched by the
``tg-admin toolbox`` command.
