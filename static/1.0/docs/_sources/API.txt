(based on version 0.9).


API
---

You can find the epydoc-generated `TurboGears API reference
<http://www.turbogears.org/1.0/docs/api/>`_ here.

This is for the latest version in the TurboGears 1.0 branch.

If you want to build the API reference for the HEAD of the
1.0 SVN branch, do the following:

#. Export the full branch sources from SVN::

        svn export http://svn.turbogears.org/branches/1.0 turbogears

#. See the file ``turbogears/doc/README.txt`` and follow the instructions
   given there. For the impatient, here's a quick summary:

   #. Make sure that you have epydoc >= 3.0 installed.

   #. Run the following commands from a terminal::

        $ cd turbogears
        $ ./doc/build_api_docs.sh

      If you are on Windows, you have to look at the ``docs/build-api_docs.sh``
      Bash script and figure out the commands you have to run yourself.
