Using Alternative JavaScript/Ajax Libraries
===========================================

You can use any of your favourite JavaScript/Ajax libraries with TurboGears.


Include JavaScript Manually
---------------------------

Just put them in the ``static/javascript`` directory in your project's package directory, like you
would do with your own custom JavaScript code.

In your templates, you can include them like this::

    <script src="${tg.url('/static/javascript/mylib.js')}" type="text/javascript" />


Use Pre-packaged Libraries
--------------------------

Some popular JavaScript libraries have been wrapped as TurboGears :doc:`Widgets <Widgets/index>`
and can be found in the CogBin_ or downloaded through the Cheeseshop_.

To use them, you just have to include the name of the widget object (including the name of the
package that contains it) in the list of widgets in the ``tg.include_widgets`` setting in
``app.cfg``, e.g.

::

    tg.include_widgets = ['jquery.jquery']
