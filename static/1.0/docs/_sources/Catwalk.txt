What is CatWalk?
----------------

CatWalk is a single page (buzzword compliant) AJAX application build on top of
TurboGears. With it you can easily interact with your application data model and
manage your data. Think of it as phpMyAdmin or pgAdmin at the ORM level instead
of the RDBMS. It is database agnostic, all it's information is pulled out of
SQLObject - not from the underlying data store.


Use CatWalk
-----------

There are two main ways in which you can access CatWalk. The preferred method is to
:doc:`open it directly from the toolbox <Toolbox>`.

You may instead want to mount CatWalk as a controller, though this may
compromise data security. For example::

    from turbogears.toolbox.catwalk import CatWalk
    import model

    class Root(controllers.Root):
         catwalk = CatWalk(model)

         # Your controllers here


You may then access CatWalk from the browser, like so:
``http://example.org/catwalk``.


Constraining access with identity
---------------------------------

If your application is on a network, and you mount CatWalk as a controller, everybody
on that network will be able to access CatWalk as well. To constrain access to
it, you can use TurboGears' :doc:`identity <Identity/index>`.

Once you have set up and configured :doc:`identity <Identity/index>`, you can constrain access to CatWalk
using rules relevant for your setup. For example, in the following application there
is an "admin" group and access to CatWalk is granted only to it's members::

    from turbogears.toolbox.catwalk import CatWalk
    from turbogears import identity
    import model

    class Root(controllers.Root):
         catwalk = CatWalk(model)
         catwalk = identity.SecureObject(catwalk,identity.in_group('admin'))

.. _identity: Identity

User interface overview
-----------------------

.. image:: images/catwalk_overview.png

1.  the left column lists all the SQLObject classes described in your model
2.  the grid widget lists the records available for the selected class and
    lets you remove or edit a record
3.  you can add a new record as well
4.  fields for joins display the number of related records (if any)

.. image:: images/catwalk_configure_columns.png

CatWalk lets you configure the order of the columns by dragging and dropping.
You can toggle their visibility as well.

The detail view lets you edit a record and manage its relations in context.
