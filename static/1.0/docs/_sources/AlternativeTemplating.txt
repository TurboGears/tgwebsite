Using Alternate Templating Engines
==================================

Out of the box, TurboGears 1.0 supports Kid templates. TurboGears has tight
integration for Kid, including an internationalization filter and the use of
Kid for widgets.

To make migrating to TurboGears easier, TurboGears provides some seamless
support for using other template engines, and the project maintains the
TurboCheetah plugin providing support for `Cheetah`_.  Additionally, TurboGears
uses a template engine :doc:`plugin interface <TemplatePlugins>` that is shared with other tools,
notably `Buffet`_ for CherryPy. This provides access to a broad range of
pre-built template plugins.

Using another template engine
-----------------------------

The plugins come in the form of Python Eggs. Once you've ``easy_install``'d the
plugin, TurboGears will automatically have the ability to render the new
templates. You can use the ``tg-admin info`` command to determine which template
engines are currently supported by your TurboGears installation.

Each template engine has a name or "scheme" to identify it. Kid templates use
the ``"kid"`` scheme. Cheetah templates use the ``"cheetah"`` scheme. By default,
TurboGears uses Kid templates, but you can easily use a Cheetah template for a
specific method like this::

        @turbogears.expose(template="cheetah:yourpackage.templates.filename")
        def index(self):
            return dict(someval=5)

When rendering the output from this method, TurboGears will notice the template
scheme in front and use the appropriate engine for that kind of template.

Using an alternate template engine does not affect how JSON output is handled:
you can still choose to output JSON if you've set the ``allow_json`` flag.

You can also choose to use a specific engine for all of your application or for
a specific path through the ``tg.defaultview`` config setting in ``config/app.cfg``.
Just set ``tg.defaultview`` to the name of the template engine you want. The
default is ``"kid"``, but you could also set it to ``"cheetah"``, for example:


    # <mypackage>/config/app.cfg
    [global]
    ...
    # VIEW

    # which view (template engine) to use if one is not specified in the
    # template name
    tg.defaultview = "cheetah"
    ...
