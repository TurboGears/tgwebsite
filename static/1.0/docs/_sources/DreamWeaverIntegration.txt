DreamWeaver Integration
=======================


Problem
-------

DreamWeaver is a useful IDE but it doesn't recognize Kid files as HTML and will **not** allow you to edit them.


Solution
--------

DreamWeaver must be taught that the type .kid is HTML like. Alas, there is no UI to do this.
Two files must be edited:

1.  Configuration\\Extensions.txt
2.  Configuration\\DocumentTypes\\MMDocumentTypes.xml

.. _DocumentTypes?: /wiki/DocumentTypes

The editing is basically, where you see a line or doctype for html with a list of extensions,
you can add ``kid`` to the list. The `DreamWeaver tech note`__ says it best.

One important point to note is that on windows these files can live in several locations.
They will be in the Configuration directory beneath the DreamWeaver install directory
and they will Application Data directory.

For example:

1.  C:\Program Files\Macromedia\Dreamweaver MX 2004\Configuration
2.  C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\Macromedia\Dreamweaver MX 2004\Configuration

Once I edited the files in both locations and restarted DreamWeaver I could edit
the files in the IDE and they were rendered as HTML reasonably well. The other thing
I did was to make my DreamWeaver project lock down to the right level such that
/static hrefs would point to my /static folder.
