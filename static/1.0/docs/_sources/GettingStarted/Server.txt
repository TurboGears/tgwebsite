Starting Up The Server
======================

.. contents:
    :depth: 2


As soon as you have :ref:`quickstarted <tgadmin_quickstart>` a project, you are
ready to fire up CherryPy's built-in server and get moving! To run the server
for development you should:

#. Switch to the top level directory of your newly created project. If, for
   example, your project is called "``MyTGApp``", open a command line and
   then do::

       $ cd /path/to/MyTGApp

#. Run the provided *start script* called ``start-<pkg-name>.py`` with Python.
   E.g., if your application's package name is "``mytgapp``", then run::

        python start-mytgapp.py

You will then see console messages telling you that the server has started up
and on which port it is listening.


Accessing the Application
-------------------------

By default, the CherryPy server for your quickstarted TurboGears project
listens on port 8080, so you should see the standard welcome page by pointing
your browser at http://localhost:8080/.

.. note:: **Mac Bonjour Support**

    On the Mac, you'll be able to see your development site in safari's Bonjour
    bookmarks.


Automatically Restart
------------------------

The server watches for changes to files in your project and will automatically restart if it sees any.


Stop the Server
---------------

You can stop the server at any time by pressing ``Control-C`` (in the console).


Using a Different Server Configuration
--------------------------------------

The start script accepts one optional argument on the command line, which
specifies the path to an alternate server configuration file to use. If no file
is given, it will look for ``dev.cfg`` in the current directory, if a
``setup.py`` file is also present (development mode). If not, it will then look
for ``prod.cfg`` in the current directory and, finally, if this is not found
also, it will look for ``config/default.cfg`` within the application's
:doc:`egg </Install/DeployWithAnEgg>`.

Please refer to the :doc:`configuration </Configuration>` documentation for a reference
of the server settings that you can use in the deployment configuration files.
