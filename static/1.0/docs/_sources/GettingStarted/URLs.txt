Using URLs
==========

CherryPy makes defining what happens for a given URL quite easy: you just give
your Python objects the methods you need. In your templates and your code, you
can just use the URLs based on how you've defined them for CherryPy.

Sometimes, however, the URLs you use are affected by the environment they're
in. For example, if your whole TurboGears site is running at
``http://yoursite.com/~yourusername/tg``, you'll need to be sure that absolute
URLs take that into account.

TurboGears provides a convenient url function to create these URLs. Let's say
you want to redirect to ``/view?id=5&page=10``. You can call
``turbogears.url("/view", id=5, page=10)`` to get a URL that takes into account
the top of the site. How does it know where the top of the site is? The
``server.webpath`` configuration variable will tell it where the top of your
site is.

The url function is also available in templates as ``tg.url``.

Future versions of TurboGears will also make it easy to wire up multiple TurboGears applications in one site. The ``url`` function already understands the concept of an application root and will generate absolute URLs relative to the application root.

**Note**: in order for the ``url`` function to recognize the application root,
our root must extend from ``turbogears.controllers.RootController``. It is also recommended
that your controllers extend from ``turbogears.controllers.Controller``.
