Toolbox Info
============

The :doc:`Toolbox <Toolbox>` Info page lists the version numbers of the running
TurboGears version and other installed Python packages.

It also lists all registered plug-ins for the :doc:`entry points <EntryPointList>`,
which TurboGears provides, together with the package that provides the plug-in
and its version number.

Here is a screenshot of the Toolbox Info page:
