Admi18n is the web based internationalization (*i18n* for short) tool, which is
part of the TurboGears :doc:`Toolbox <Toolbox>`.

To use it, open the Toolbox and click on the "admi18n" link on the bottom right.

Admi18n can help you to:

* Collect translatable strings from your Python code and templates
  and generate a translation template file (``.pot``) from them.
* Add translation files (``.po``) for the languages you want to support.
* Import/export the ``.po`` and the ``.pot`` files.
* Edit the translation files through a web interface, optionally with
  the help of the Google translation web service.
* Compile the language files with your translations into message files
  (``.mo``), which can be used by the TurboGears i18n framework.

Please refer to the :doc:`internationalization <Internationalization>` documentation
for more information about the i18n framework.
