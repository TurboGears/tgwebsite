RepeatingFieldSet Tips
======================

The code in this article is abstracted from my working code, but I don't
have time to test this version (which is not 100% complete, as you
will see).  Since it took me a while to figure this out and I didn't
find any docs on it I thought I'd at least put down what I learned to
give the next person a leg up on figuring it out.

My goal was to create an edit page for an SQLObject, where I wanted
a list of sub-objects to be edited along with the main object.
RepeatingFieldSet turned out to be perfect for this.

So suppose you have a model like::

    class Foo(SQLObject):
        name = UnicodeCol()
        bars = RelatedJoin('Bar')

    class Bar(SQLObject):
        name = UnicodeCol()
        description = UnicodeCol()

We can edit a Foo and all its Bars in one go with the following
set of widgets::

    form = TableForm(fields=[
        TextField(name='name',label='Name'),
        RepeatingFieldSet(
            name='bars',
            label='Bars',
            fields=[
                TextField(name='name',label='Name'),
                TextField(name='description', label='Description')
            ]
        )

Note that the name of the RepeatingFieldSet is bars, which means it will
pick up its list of values from the 'bars' field of our Foo.  Automagic
niceness.

Here's the controller::

    @expose('.templates.editform')
    def edit(self, tg_errors=None, **data):
        if tg_errors: flash("Fix your errors and resubmit")
        else: data = self.foo
        return dict(
            form=form,
            data=data,
            parms=dict(
                action=url('save'),
                submit_text="save",
                repetitions=dict(bars=len(self.foo.bars)+1)
            )
        )

This gives us one repeat of the fieldset for each Bar in Foo, and one
more besides (so the user can add a new bar in the same form).

The callout for the form in editform.kid looks like this::

    ${form.display(data, **parms)}

The trickiest bit to figure out was how to modify the template for
the RepeatingFieldSet widget.  I didn't actually want a repeating
FieldSet, what I wanted was a table.  This is what I came up with::

    <div xmlns:py="http://purl.org/kid/ns#">
    <table>
      <tr>
          <th py:for="field in fields">
            <label class="fieldlabel" for="${field.field_id}" py:content="field.label" />
          </th>
      </tr>
      <tr py:for="repetition in repetitions" class="${field_class}" id="${field_id}_${repetition}">
        <legend py:if="legend" py:content="legend" />
        <div py:for="field in hidden_fields"
            py:replace="field.display(value_for(field), **params_for(field))"
        />
        <td py:for="field in fields">
            <span py:content="field.display(value_for(field), **params_for(field))" />
            <span py:if="error_for(field)" class="fielderror" py:content="error_for(field)" />
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </div>

The 'repetition in repetitions' does some black mojo behind the scenes
so that when we have reached repetition N in the loop, the various
functions of each 'field' in 'fields' will pull data from the Nth
element of the list of bars.  But fields is just the widget list of the
RepeatingFieldSet, so we can access the attributes of the widgets that do
not relate to values, such as the label, at any point.  That enables us
to set the titles for the table columns before starting the values loop.
