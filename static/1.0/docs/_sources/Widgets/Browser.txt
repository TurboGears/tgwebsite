WidgetBrowser
=============

What is WidgetBrowser?
----------------------

WidgetBrowser is an application which collects all available TurboGears Widgets
installed on your system and allows you to preview all TurboGears Widgets
available to you easily and view their documentation and source code.


Use WidgetBrowser
-----------------

You can access WidgetBrowser by :doc:`opening it directly from the toolbox </Toolbox>`.

Let's take the ``AutoComplete`` widget as an example.

The ``Sample`` Tab displays the widget as it would look in your application. It
is fully functional, so feel free to type a few letters to test the
functionality. To see the source code that's being used to display the sample,
flip over to the appropriately named ``Source Code`` tab. It's not always
obvious what a particular widget does given only the preview and source, so the
widget author can provide both a ``Description`` and the list of
``Parameters``, which the WidgetBrowser displays.

TurboGears widgets were designed to provide common behavior without necessarily
being tied to a particular view. To this end, it's possible to modify the
templates and the ``Template`` tab provides you with a starting point to modify
as you see fit.

In summary:

=============== ======== =====================================================================
Tab Name        Note     Description
=============== ======== =====================================================================
Sample                   An example of a widget instance.
Source Code              The Python code needed to invoke the widget.
Template                 The Kid template for the sample.
Description     optional Describes the behavior for unusually-behaving (read "Ajax") widgets.
Parameters      optional Lists parameters for widgets which take extra parameters.
=============== ======== =====================================================================

TurboGears attempts to provide a solid collection of the most common widgets,
but can't cover all possible widgets. To that end the `TurboGears Cogbin`_
provides a collecting point for more exotic widget collections.
