Lots of people use Django templates as part of the Django Web Framework. You can use Django templates as part of your TurboGears project with this step by step guide:

Step 0. Install TurboDjango By SetupTools
-----------------------------------------

TurboDjango Template Plugin
============================

TurboDjango is the TurboGears "Django template" plugin which is developed by Fred Lin, the project is hosted at SourceForge_.

.. _SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tgwidgets

To get Django templates to work with TurboGears, first install the plugin by running this command on your console::

    $ easy_install TurboDjango

And be sure that you already have Django installed.

Alternative:TurboJinja Template Plugin
======================================

You can use the alternative TurboJinja plugin, which allows you to use "Django template"-like syntax without having to install Django. This project is hosted at SourceForge_ as well.

Install the plugin by running this command on your console::

    $ easy_install TurboJinja

The Jinja templating plugin will be installed automatically.

The following guide works for both Template Plugins.


Step 1. Quickstart
------------------

Use the ``tg-admin`` command to create a new project ('``turbodj``' in this example)::

    $ tg-admin quickstart turbodj


Step 2. Edit Controller
-----------------------

Enter your ``turbodj`` project directory, edit ''``/turbodj/controller.py``'', and add the following method to the "Root" class::

   @expose(template = "django:turbodj.templates.djpage")
   def page(self):
       return dict(name="TurboGears")

In the expose decorator we use the ``django:`` template scheme, with "djpage" as the django template filename (under the templates directory).

Step 3. Edit Template
---------------------

Edit ``/turbodj/templates/djpage.html``::

      <h1>Hello, {{name}}</h1>

The template has an "html" file suffix.

Step 4. Test if it works
------------------------

In turbodj directory, start the development server by running ''start-turbodj'' script::

     $ start-turbodj

Open the browser and enter the url: http://localhost:8080/page. You'll see:

    **Hello, TurboGears**
