How to make your project available on the Cheeseshop
----------------------------------------------------

Before you can upload your project to the Cheeseshop_, you will need an account. You can create one `on the PyPi registration page. <http://www.python.org/pypi?:action=register_form>`_

After you have created an account, you will need to tell ``setuptools`` your account information for uploading the file. `This tutorial <http://www.python.org/~jeremy/weblog/030924.html>`_ should be enough to get you going.

Now that you have your account configured, you need to register a page for your application. ``setuptools`` can do this for you automatically with the following command::

    python setup.py register

Once you have everything configured, setuptools can upload your .egg automatically. Here is the command you need::

    python setup.py bdist_egg upload

You can also register projects and upload your eggs manually. See the PyPi documentation for details on this. Any eggs you created should be available in the dist/ folder of your project.

Making your project available in the CogBin
-------------------------------------------

The CogBin_ scans the CheeseShop for updated packages and looks for keywords it recognizes. To make your project available in the CogBin, simply add the appropriate keyword(s) to your ``setup.py`` file:

* Applications:  	``turbogears.app``
* Widgets:	``turbogears.widgets``
* Template Plugins: 	``python.templating.engines``
* Identity Providers: 	``turbogears.identity.provider``
* tg-admin Commands: 	``turbogears.command``

This goes in the ``keywords`` argument to ``setup()`` in your ``setup.py`` file. If you are using the file provided in a quickstarted project these options should already be listed, just uncomment the ones you need.
