SQLObject Foreign Keys
======================

Foreign keys in SQLObject have a little bit of extra requirements due to the fact
that they are mapping objects onto tables. For SQLObject to interact correctly
with a foreign key relationship the object representing the table being referred
to needs to know how the data is related. A code example will probably make this clearer::

    class Person(SQLObject):
        firstName = StringCol()
        lastName = StringCol()
        address = MultipleJoin('Address')

    class Address(SQLObject):
        street = StringCol()
        city = StringCol()
        state = StringCol(length=2)
        zip = StringCol(length=9)
        person = ForeignKey('Person')

The above pair of tables create a one to many relationship between the Person
class (one) and the Address class (many). In addition to ``MultipleJoin`` there
are methods for many-to-many relationships (``RelatedJoin``) and one-to-one
relationships (``SingleJoin``). There are also additional keywords for these
functions that add more features. See the `SQLObject Documentation`_ for more
details, but be aware that newer releases of SQLObject may change how these
features are handled.
