Start it Up
-----------

The toolbox is started from the shell using the :doc:`tg-admin utility <TgAdmin>`::

  tg-admin toolbox

The toolbox opens a new browser and points it to the toolbox, now running on port 7654. This restricts access to local requests only (127.0.0.1) so you would want to pass the IP address of the machine you want access from. For example::

  tg-admin toolbox -n -c 192.168.0.1 -c 192.168.0.2

This command will allow access from IPs 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2, and the ``-n`` flag disables the browser window from automatically opening.
