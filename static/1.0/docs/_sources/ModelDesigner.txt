ModelDesigner
=============

ModelDesigner is a code generation tool for SQLObject models. It
allows you to describe your models through the web in a context-aware
environment rather than forcing you to code your models by hand. ModelDesigner
also provides a convenient diagram view so that you can get a high level
overview of your model as you design it.

When you're happy with your model, ModelDesigner will generate the SQLObject
code for the model and optionally generate your database tables.

Note: If you start toolbox from the same directory as last time, your last
session is displayed as "Existing Designer Session". It gets saved in that
directory as ``model_designer.tmp``. If you want to add it as a sample,
save it as ``YourModel.js`` in the session directory of the designer.

Here are a few screenshots of ModelDesigner in action:
