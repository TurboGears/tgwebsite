Downloading and Installing TurboGears
=====================================

  :depth: 2


Quickstart Instructions
-----------------------

Installing the latest stable version of TurboGears 1.0 from scratch is most
easily achieved with the `tgsetup.py`_ script.


The Standard Way (tgsetup.py)
-----------------------------

There are only two steps necessary to install TurboGears, if you already have Python
installed. If you don't have Python installed on your system (or are not sure about it),
please refer to the detailed installation instructions in the next section.

1. Download the `tgsetup.py`_ script.

2. Run the script from the command-line::

    $ python tgsetup.py

We strongly suggest that you also refer to the system-specific installation instructions
for details.

   SupportedSystems
   Python2.3Support

* Windows, Mac OS X 10.3/4 or Linux/Unix,
  see also :doc:`Supported Operating Systems <SupportedSystems>`
* Python >= 2.3.x, < 3.x (naturally, details see below)
* An internet connection (for off-line installation see below)
* About 20-25 MB of disk space, depending on your OS, architecture and filesystem
* On some systems you need a C compiler, to compile Python C-extensions from some
  components that are required by TurboGears. See the detailed instructions for your
  platform for details.
* If you need to compile extensions, you'll also need Python header files and libraries.
  If they are not included in your Python installation, they can usually be installed
  with a package called ``python-dev``, ``python-devel`` or similar.
* (Recommended) A database system (see below)

.. note::
    The recommended Python version to use with TurboGears 1.0 currently is **2.5.x**,
    but we still support **Python 2.4.x** and (:doc:`with some restrictions <Python2.3Support>`)
    **Python 2.3.x**. Python 2.5.x is supported from TurboGears version **1.0.2** onwards and
    Python 2.6.x from 1.0.9 and later.

    TurboGears **does not support** Python 3.x yet.

There are some detailed installation instructions for different platforms
and setups, starting with instructions for installing Python to
platform-specific configuration issues.

Please choose the instructions that match your setup:

* :doc:`Installation on Windows <Windows>`
* :doc:`Installation on Mac OS X <Mac>`
* :doc:`Installing on Debian <Debian>`
* :doc:`Intalling TurboGears on Ubuntu Linux <Ubuntu>`

* :doc:`Installation Without root Privileges <NonRoot>`
* :doc:`Installation Without an Internet Connection (off-line Install) <Offline>`
* :doc:`Installing TurboGears on a host behind a proxy <BehindProxy>`
* :doc:`Installation Troubleshooting <Troubleshooting>`

Database Installation and Configuration
----------------------------------------

   /Database/SQLite
   /Database/MySQL
   /Database/PostgreSQL
   /Database/Firebird

TurboGears is designed to work in conjunction with an object-relational mapper
such as :doc:`SQLObject </SQLObject/index>` or :doc:`SQLAlchemy </SQLAlchemy/index>`,
so TurboGears can use all the databases supported by these ORMs.
If you have one of the supported DBAPI implementations in
:doc:`Database Options </Database/index>`, you should be settled.

If you need to choose a database option, SQLite is an easy-to-use database to get
started with, which works with plain files or in-memory databases. If you are
using Python 2.5, SQLite is supported out of the box and you don't need to install pysqlite.

Here we list installation and configuration instructions for the most common databases:

    * :doc:`SQLite </Database/SQLite>`
    * :doc:`MySQL </Database/MySQL>`
    * :doc:`PostgreSQL </Database/PostgreSQL>`
    * :doc:`Firebird </Database/Firebird>`


Where Are the Download Files?
-----------------------------

Generally, downloads are done through the easy_install-based `tgsetup.py`_
script.  There is a `list of files`_ available if you need to do something
manually.

Specific Version Installation
-----------------------------

Installing an older version of TurboGears is possible, too. To install a
specific version of TurboGears run a command line similar to this one::

    $ easy_install -i http://www.turbogears.org/1.0/downloads/1.0.x/index TurboGears==1.0.x

Replace ``1.0.x`` with the number of the version of TurboGears which you want
to install. This form requires setuptools_ to be present on your machine. If
you don't have setuptools yet, download and run `ez_setup.py`_ to install it::

    $ wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
    $ python ez_setup.py

After installing TurboGears you probably also want to install at least one of
the object-relational mappers, :doc:`SQLObject </SQLObject/index>`
or :doc:`SQLAlchemy </SQLAlchemy/index>`::

    $ easy_install SQLAlchemy

or::

    $ easy_install SQLObject
