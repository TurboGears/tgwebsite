Installing TurboGears on a host behind a proxy
==============================================

You probably reached this page, because you encountered a problem when trying to install TurboGears. When you run `easy_install`_ or `tgsetup.py`_, you get something like this ::

    Searching for turbogears
    Reading http://www.turbogears.org/preview/download/index.html
    error: Download error: (10060, 'Operation timed out')

.. _easy_install: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
.. _tgsetup.py: http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbogears1/files/1.0/tgsetup.py

This may mean, that you are behind a proxy and easy_install is not able to access the files it wants to download. But fear not, there is an `environment variable`_ which you can set, to tell easy_install about your proxy.

Linux
-----
::

    export http_proxy="http://your.proxy.com:yourPort"

or if you need proxy authentication: ::

    export http_proxy="http://user:passwd@your.proxy.com:yourPort"


Windows
-------

tested on XP ::

    set HTTP_PROXY=http://your.proxy.com:yourPort

you can also use the "" in windows


Mac

Try again
---------

After setting the proxy, run the ``easy_install`` command again (you may need to log out and in again or open a new command line window for the environment change to take effect)::

    easy_install -i http://www.turbogears.org/1.0/downloads/current/index TurboGears

Workaround
----------

If, by some chance, you can't set the proxy or want to do an offline install, download all the eggs and run easy_install with the ``-f`` option pointing to the directory where you downloaded the packages. See also "How can I do offline installations?" in the :doc:`FAQ </FAQ>`.
