TurboGears Installation on Mac OS X
===================================

.. contents::
  :depth: 2


Getting Python
--------------

Your Mac comes with Python built into the system. The latest release of Mac OS
X, version 10.5 ("Leopard") even comes with Python 2.5. Mac OS X 10.4 ("Tiger")
only has Python 2.3 pre-installed. While TurboGears 1.0 works with Python 2.3,
it is strongly recommended that you upgrade to Python 2.5. The decorator syntax
supported by Python 2.4 and higher will make your life much more pleasant and
you'll be using a *lot* of decorators in TurboGears.

So, if you are on OS X 10.4, here's how to upgrade Python:

#. Download `Python 2.5 for the Mac`_. Follow the link that says "installer for
   the latest version".
#. Run the installer.
#. Open the Terminal application (under "Applications/Utilities").
#. Run the command ``echo $PATH`` and make sure that ``/usr/local/bin`` appears
   before ``/usr/bin`` in your path! If it's not there, check the section
   "How Do I Change my Path on Mac OS X?" below for tips on changing it.

.. note:: The recommended Python version to use with TurboGears 1.0.x
    currently is **2.5.x**, but we still support **Python 2.4.x** and (`with
    some restrictions`_) **Python 2.3.x**. Python 2.5.x is supported from
    TurboGears version **1.0.2** onwards.

Installing TurboGears
---------------------

For most people, the following works without a hitch, but if you have problems,
check the "Troubleshooting" section below.

Following these instructions will install TurboGears and all required packages
under the installation directory of your Python installation, so you need
to use ``sudo`` to be able to write files there and in ``/usr/local/bin``.

.. note:: **Note**: the ``$`` at the start of the command line examples given
   below denotes the shell prompt. You don't need to enter this.

#. Open the Terminal application (under "Applications/Utilities").

#. Make sure you have at least Python 2.4, or better 2.5::

        $ python -V

   If not, please upgrade your Python installation (see above).

#. Download `tgsetup.py`_ and run::

        $ curl -OL http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbogears1/files/1.0/tgsetup.py
        $ sudo python tgsetup.py

4. Make sure you have ``/usr/local/bin`` on your path (see below)
   and then check that everything went well by running::

        $ tg-admin info

Once you've gotten TurboGears and a database driver installed, jump over to the
`20 minute wiki`_ tutorial to get your feet wet.

Also consider signing up for the mailing list. We're always happy to help
people work through their problems and you might have something to share with us.

Installing Without root Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you can see from the use of the ``sudo`` command, the standard installation
procedure described above, requires root privileges to install TurboGears
system-wide. You can also install TurboGears below your home directory.
This setup is described on the page :doc:`How to Install TurboGears Without root Privileges <NonRoot>`.


Database Driver
---------------

If you plan to use a database with TurboGears, you will need to install the
appropriate driver. You can either download it from the `PythonMac packages
page`_ or use ``easy_install``. Below is a list of databases and their drivers
available from this page:

* :doc:`MySQL </Database/MySQL>` - MySQL_python (formerly known as MySQLdb)
* :doc:`PostgreSQL </Database/PostgreSQL>`- psycopg2
* :doc:`SQLite </Database/SQLite>` - pysqlite2
* :doc:`Others </Database/index>`, as supported by SQLObject or SQLAlchemy

To install a database module with ``easy_install``:

#. Open the Terminal application (under "Applications/Utilities") and
   check whether you already have ``easy_install``, by running the command::

        $ which easy_install

   If you get no output, you don't have it on your system.

#. If you don't have ``easy_install``, either perform the TurboGears
   installation, as described above, first (which also installs
   ``easy_install`` for you) **or** download the `ez_setup.py`_ script
   and run::

        $ curl -O http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
        $ sudo python ez_setup.py

#. Then install your preferred database module with:

   .. parsed-literal::

        $ sudo easy_install *package-name*

   e.g::

        $ sudo easy_install pysqlite

You only need one driver, but if you choose MySQL or PostgreSQL, it's nice to have
SQLite for testing and initial development. If you are using Python 2.5, SQLite
is supported out of the box and you don't need to install pysqlite.

How Do I Change my Path on Mac OS X?
------------------------------------

Mac OS X is Unix-like under the hood. There are many ways to accomplish just
about anything, including setting your path.

If you haven't already, run ``echo $PATH`` and check to see that
``/usr/local/bin`` is there and that it appears before ``/usr/bin/``. If not,
you'll need to add it to either your own profile or to the system profile.
First, you'll need to see which shell you're using::

    echo $SHELL

If the output is ``/bin/tcsh``::

    echo 'set path = (/usr/local/bin $path)' >> ~/.cshrc
    source ~/.cshrc

If the output is ``/bin/bash/``::

    echo 'PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH; export PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
    source ~/.bash_profile

This will apply to your current user only. To set it system wide, you'll have to
edit ``/etc/profile``, but that's beyond the scope of this tutorial.


Troubleshooting
---------------

Problem
    The installation fails with an error message containing "``gcc failed``".
Diagnosis
    The installation procedure tried to install a required package that contains
    a C-extension and could not find a pre-compiled binary egg for your operating
    system and/or architecture. It then tried to compile the extension on your
    system and failed, because no compiler could be found.
Solution
    a. Install the `Xcode`_ developer tools and try again.
    b. Post a request to the mailing list asking for someone to upload a
       matching binary egg for your system/architecture to ``turbogears.org``.

Problem
    When I try to run ``tg-admin`` command after the installation, I get the
    message ``bash: tg-admin: command not found``.
Diagnosis
    Did you check that ``/usr/local/bin`` is on the command search path?
Solution
    Prepend ``/usr/local/bin`` to the PATH environment variable (see above).

Please also check the :doc:`installation troubleshooting <Troubleshooting>`
page for common problems not specific to Mac installation and if you are still
stuck feel free to ask for help on the mailing list.
