easy_install can't find one of the packages!
--------------------------------------------

Diagnosis
    In order to ensure that the components all work together properly,
    TurboGears is set up to require specific versions of the component projects
    and will sometimes rely on unreleased versions. Because of this,
    ``easy_install`` is not always able to find the right package in PyPI. If
    this is the case, we will upload the specific package to the `download page`_
    on ``turbogears.org``, where it will be picked up by the :doc:`standard
    installation procedure <index>` via ``tgsetup.py``.
Solution
    Please be sure to follow the download instructions for your platform and
    use ``tgsetup.py``.

    If you must insist on using ``easy_install`` directly, try adding the
    appropriate download URL via the ``-i`` option, like this::

        easy_install -i http://www.turbogears.org/1.0/downloads/current/index TurboGears

    If this does not work for you, use ``-f`` instead of ``-i``:

        easy_install -f http://www.turbogears.org/1.0/downloads/current/index TurboGears

    Please note that this is not supported and several things may go wrong,
    which you need to fix manually.

Error: No local packages or download links found for TurboGears
---------------------------------------------------------------

Diagnosis
    This error most commonly reflects that a firewall is preventing
    the download of the package or you need to go through a proxy to
    access the web.
Solution
    Here is the suggestion from Phillip Eby:

    You'll need to either find a way to bypass the firewall (e.g. using
    http://ntlmaps.sf.net/ ), or else manually download all required ``.egg``
    files from the `download page`_ to a temporary directory, and then run::

        easy_install -f <dldir> TurboGears

    where ``<dldir>`` is the directory you downloaded the .egg files to.

   If you need to use a proxy to access the web, you can tell ``easy_install``
   to use the proxy by setting the ``http_proxy`` environment variable to point
   to your proxy server.


Conflict Warning
----------------

Diagnosis
    TurboGears relies on a new Python packaging format called Python Eggs
    (you may also see references to the ``setuptools`` package, which
    provides the functionality for handling Eggs). If you have an older,
    non-egg installation of a package used by TurboGears, ``easy_install``
    will display a conflict warning.
Solution
    In order to get TurboGears running, you need to have the eggs properly
    installed. There are two options for doing this:

    * a non-root installation and
    * deletion of the existing package.

    A non-root installation preserves all of your existing Python setup,
    but is more complex. If you have concerns that your system might not
    like different versions of the libraries, this is the safe route to take.
    See the page :doc:`How to Install TurboGears Without root Privileges <NonRoot>` for more information.

    Please see the :doc:`TurboGears Uninstallation <Uninstall>` page for
    information on how to install packages.


Error: Couldn't find a setup script in TurboGears
-------------------------------------------------

Diagnosis
    Phillip Eby's (author of setuptools/``easy_install``) explanation:

    When you get "Couldn't find a setup script in TurboGears", it means
    that you are running in a directory that has a subdirectory called
    "``TurboGears``". Don't do that, because ``easy_install`` sees that
    you asked for TurboGears, and it sees there's a TurboGears directory,
    so it tries to install that. Unless the directory is a TurboGears
    *source* checkout, it's not going to work.
Solution
    Change to a different directory, or get rid of the TurboGears
    subdirectory!

    Note, by the way, that Windows and OS X have case-insensitive
    filesystems, so the directory could be called 'turbogears' and it
    would have the same problem.

    If you're running in a TurboGears checkout with a setup.py present,
    do this instead::

        sudo easy_install --script-dir=/usr/local/bin .

    Notice that there's a "``.``" instead of "``TurboGears``" - we're
    telling it to install this directory, not a subdirectory.


I'm seeing a "File Exists" error
--------------------------------

Diagnosis
    On Windows machines, there appears to be a problem when setuptools
    thinks it needs to overwrite cElementTree.
Solution
    The easiest solution to this is to install with the ``--always-unzip``
    option to ``tgsetup.py`` resp. ``easy_install``. You can also fix the
    immediate error by deleting the
    ``Documents and Settings\Your User\ApplicationSettings\Python Eggs``
    directory.


error: invalid Python installation
----------------------------------

Problem
    I get the following error message in the middle of the installation
    process::

        error: invalid Python installation: unable to open
        /usr/lib/python2.4/config/Makefile (No such file or directory)
Diagnosis
   On some Linux systems, notably Debian-based systems, you'll need to have
   the Python development package (called ``python2.4-dev`` or
   ``python-devel`` or similar) installed in order to be able to compile C
   extensions.
Solution
   Install the Pyton development package using your system's package management.
   See the detailed :doc:`installation instructions <index>` for your system for the
   necessary steps.


gcc failed
----------

Problem
    The installation fails with an error message containing "gcc failed".
Diagnosis
    The installation procedure tried to install a required package that contains
    a C-extension and could not find a pre-compiled binary egg for your operating
    system and/or architecture. It then tried to compile the extension on your
    system and failed, because no compiler could be found.
Solution
    Install a C compiler and a proper build environment. See the detailed
    :doc:`installation instructions <index>` for your system for the necessary steps.


You are required to install SQLObject
-------------------------------------

Problem
    I have created a new project with ``tg-admin quickstart``. When I try to
    start it, I get the error message::

        You are required to install SQLObject but appear not to have done so.
        Please run your projects setup.py or run `easy_install SQLObject`.
Diagnosis
    You have created a project that has identity support and therefor needs a
    database module, which you must install yourself.
Solution
    Install the ``SQLObject`` package by following the commands given in the
    error message.

    If you did not enable identity and are still getting this error, please
    refer to `bug #1620`_.

.. _bug #1620: http://trac.turbogears.org/ticket/1620


SQLObject is missing, toolbox designer won't work
-------------------------------------------------

Problem
    After installing TurboGears you run ``tg-admin info`` or ``tg-admin quickstart`` and you
    get this warning::

        SQLObject is missing, toolbox designer won't work
Diagnosis
    Recent versions of TurboGears do not install an ORM (SQLObject/SQLAlchemy) automatically
    anymore. The Toolbox Designer will not work without SQLObject installed. If you don't need
    it, you can ignore this warning.
Solution
    You either have to create a project, which needs SQLObject/SQLAlchemy (for example by enabling
    identity) and then install it via ``python setup.py install`` or ``python setup.py develop`` or
    install SQLObject manually via easy_install::

         easy_install -U "SQLObject>=0.8,<=0.10.0"


TypeError: iterable argument required
-------------------------------------

Problem
    ::

        File "/usr/local/lib/python2.4/urllib2.py", line 580, in proxy_open
            if '@' in host:
        TypeError: iterable argument required
Diagnosis
    You probably have a syntax error in your proxy URL specification.
Solution
    Ray Smith (http://RaymeondSmith.com) writes:

    Set the ``http_proxy`` environment variable with:

    Windows::

        $ set HTTP_PROXY=http://user:password@proxy:port

    Unix/Mac OS X::

        $ export http_proxy="http://user:password@proxy:port

    Then try the installation again.


ZipImportError: not a Zip file
------------------------------

Problem
    I'm using Windows XP SP2, Python 2.4.4 getting the following error
    during installation::

        C:\>tgsetup.py
        [...]
        zipimport.ZipImportError: not a Zip file: '[...]\TurboGears-1.0.1-py2.4.egg'
Diagnosis
    The TruboGears egg file got corrupted during the download. This may be
    caused by misbehaving personal firewalls or virus scanners.
Solution
    Turn off the personal firewall, e.g. "Norten Internet Security" or similar,
    and try to install again


OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int
---------------------------------------------------

Problem
   After installation, when I try to create a new project with
   ``tg-admin quickstart``, I get::

        OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int
Diagnosis
    You probably have an outdated or incompatible version of the ``RuleDispatch``
    package installed.
Solution
    Upgrade ``RuleDispatch`` with::

        $ easy_install -U RuleDispatch


yum: Nothing to do
------------------

Problem
    I get the following ouput when trying to install TurboGears::


        Loading "fastestmirror" plugin
        Loading "installonlyn" plugin
        Loading "skip-broken" plugin

    Why do I get the last message?
Diagnisis
    You seem to be using ``yum`` to install a TurboGears RPM package. These
    packages are not supported by the TurboGears project itself.
Solution
    Follow the standard :doc:`installation instructions <index>` or ask the provider
    of the packages you are trying to install for support.


Python script was built with Visual Studio 2003
-----------------------------------------------

Problem
    ::

        Setup script exited with error: Python script was built with
        Visual Studio 2003
Diagnosis
    None
Solution
    Unknown. If you encounter this problem, please post a detailed
    report to the mailing list.
