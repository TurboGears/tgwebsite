Installing From Subversion
==========================

Installation instructions to install TurboGears from Subversion.

1. Make sure python.exe and Scripts/ directory from the Python installation
   are on your system PATH.

2. Install latest setuptools:

  * Download and run http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py

3. Checkout TurboGears source:

  * svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/turbogears1/code/branches/1.0/ turbogears

4. Go to turbogears/thirdparty folder and install components found there:

  * easy_install cherrypy

  * easy_install kid

  * easy_install paste

  * easy_install sqlobject

5. Return to turbogears folder and run ``setup.py develop``. This should install
   TurboGears itself along with fetch and install all extra dependencies for
   Turbogears, like RuleDispatch.

**Note for Windows:**

If you do not have a C compiler you won't be able to install cElementTree from source.
Instead do ::

  easy_install -f http://www.turbogears.org/1.0/downloads/current/index cElementTree

to download and install pre-packaged version from Turbogears' site.
