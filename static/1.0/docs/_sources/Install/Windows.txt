TurboGears Installation on Windows
==================================

.. contents::
  :depth: 2


Getting Python
--------------

If you're new to Python, welcome. It's a great language

1. Grab the `Python 2.5 Installer`_.
2. Run the installer.
3. Add Python to your path.

   To do this, go to ``System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables``
   and add or edit the ``PATH`` variable to have ``;C:\Python25;C:\Python25\Scripts``,
   assuming you installed Python to the default location.

.. _python 2.5 installer: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.4/

.. note:: The recommended Python version to use with TurboGears 1.0
    currently is **2.5.x**, but we still support **Python 2.4.x** and
    (:doc:`with some restrictions <Python2.3Support>`) **Python 2.3.x**.
    Python 2.5.x is supported from TurboGears version **1.0.2** onwards.


Installing TurboGears
---------------------

You can run Python from any shell if your Python scripts directory is on your path.
By default the scripts directory is C:\Python25\Scripts

1. Open up a command line prompt (``Start -> Run`` and type ``cmd``)
2. Download `tgsetup.py`_ and run

  ::

    python tgsetup.py

3. Make sure your installation succeeded by running ``tg-admin info``.

.. _tgsetup.py: http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbogears1/files/1.0/tgsetup.py


Once you've gotten TurboGears and a database driver installed, jump over to the
`20 minute wiki`_ tutorial or the `getting started guide`_ to get your feet wet.

Also consider signing up for the `discussion`_ or `announcement`_ mailing list.
We're always happy to help people work through their problems and you might have
something to share with us. There's also an irc channel, ``#turbogears`` on
``irc.freenode.net``.

Database Drivers
----------------

If you're just doing development on your desktop, you can use pysqlite. You can
get the latest version from the `pysqlite download page`_.

.. warning:: ``easy_install pysqlite`` does not work currently
   for all versions of Python. Use the binary installer for your Python version
   from the pysqlite page instead.

If you're doing this on a production server, you'll probably want to use MySQL
(using the ``MySQLdb`` driver) or Postgres (using the ``psycopg2`` driver),
though you could use :doc:`several other databases </Database/index>` if you like.

Get Help
--------

For the most part, installation goes off without a hitch, but if you have
problems, feel free to ask for `help`_.
