TurboGears Installation on Ubuntu Linux
=======================================

.. contents::
    :depth: 1


Ubuntu 7.04 "Feisty Fawn" and 8.04 "Gutsy Gibbon"
-------------------------------------------------

Since the release of version 1.0.2.2 TurboGears supports Python 2.5, which is the default Python version on
Ubuntu >= 7.04, which makes installation much easier.

To get started with TurboGears, you need to do following:

1. Open up a command line prompt (*Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal*)
2. Install essential packages to compile python modules::

       $ sudo apt-get install gcc libc6-dev build-essential python-dev python-setuptools python-profiler

  On a clean installed Ubuntu, **gcc**, **libc6-dev**, **build-essential**, **python-dev** packages are
  required for compiling Python C-extension packages. We provide binary eggs for Linux for all C-extensions
  used, but when a new version of a C-extension is released, having the compiler chain installed
  ensures that your install won't break.

  **python-profiler** (located in multiverse) is recomended. See :doc:`Optimization </Optimization>`
  for more infomation.

  **python-setuptools** allows you to use the ``easy_install`` command to fetch and install
  Python modules (including TurboGears extensions) from the Cheeseshop_ (aka Python Package index).

3. **Download**  and run `tgsetup.py`_ to install TurboGears::

    $ sudo python tgsetup.py

  Make sure that the ``python`` command points to the version 2.5 of the Python interpreter.
  Run ``python -V`` to check.

  Alternatively, use ``easy_install``::

    $ sudo easy_install --prefix /usr/local \
        -f http://www.turbogears.org/download/index.html \
        "TurboGears[standard]==1.0.X"

  (Replace ``X`` with the minor version number of the TurboGears release you want to install.)

  Also here, you should check that the ``easy_install`` command is using Python 2.5. You can replace
  ``easy_install`` with ``easy_install-2.5`` to make sure.

4. Test that your installation works by running ``tg-admin info``::

   $ tg-admin info

5. Database support

  To use TurboGears properly, you'll also need a database to use with your model. Python 2.5 already
  includes an interface to the SQLite 3 library (the ``sqlite3`` module), which works well with TurboGears.
  Depending on which other databases you want to use, you can install one or more of the following packages:

  * **python-psycopg2** -- for using TurboGears with PostgreSQL (universe repository)
  * **python-mysqldb** -- for using TurboGears with MySQL
  * **python-kinterbasdb** -- for using TurboGears with Firebird / Interbase (universe repository)

  Other databases (Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Microsoft Access) can probably be used with the
  **python-adodb** package from Universe. For more information on that subject, see the
  `ADOdb for Python homepage`_.

6. Install additional, optional packages (see below)


Ubuntu 6.10 "Edgy Eft"
----------------------

To get started with TurboGears, you need to do following:

1. Open up a command line prompt (*Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal*)
2. Install essential packages to compile python modules::

       $ sudo apt-get install gcc libc6-dev build-essential python-dev python-setuptools python-profiler

  On a clean installed Ubuntu, **gcc**, **libc6-dev**, **build-essential**, **python-dev** packages are
  required for compiling Python C-extension packages. We provide binary eggs for Linux for all C-extensions
  used, but when a new version of a C-extension is released, having the compiler chain installed
  ensures that your install won't break.

  **python-profiler** (located in multiverse) is recomended.  See :doc:`Optimization </Optimization>`
  for more infomation. If you install this package, some Python 2.5 packages will be installed as well.
  This should be safe, since Python 2.4 will remain the default version on "Edgy".

  **python-setuptools** allows you to use the ``easy_install`` command to fetch and install
  Python modules (including TurboGears extensions) from the Cheeseshop_ (aka Python Package index).

3. **Download**  and run `tgsetup.py`_ to install TurboGears::

    $ sudo python tgsetup.py

  or, alternatively, use ``easy_install``::

    $ sudo easy_install --prefix /usr/local \
        -i http://www.turbogears.org/1.0/downloads/1.0.X/index \
        "TurboGears[standard]==1.0.X"

  (Replace ``X`` with the minor version number of the TurboGears release you want to install.)

4. Test that your installation works by running ``tg-admin info``::

   $tg-admin info

5. Database support

  To use TurboGears properly, you'll also need a database to use with your model.
  Depending on what database you want to use, you should install:

  * **python-pysqlite2** for SQLite 3 support (recommended)
  * **python-psycopg2** -- for using TurboGears with PostgreSQL (universe repository)
  * **python-mysqldb** -- for using TurboGears with MySQL
  * **python-kinterbasdb** -- for using TurboGears with Firebird / Interbase (universe repository)

  Other databases (Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Microsoft Access) can probably be used with the
  **python-adodb** package from Universe. For more information on that subject, see the
  `ADOdb for Python homepage`_.

6. Install additional, optional packages (see below)


Ubuntu 6.06 LTS "Dapper Drake" and Older
----------------------------------------

As normal for a Debian-based system, you'll need to install all the dev packages. The included setuptools is out of date, but using it to update itself it easier than  downloading ``ez_setup.py`` and installing it manually.

::

    $ sudo apt-get install gcc libc6-dev build-essential python-dev python-setuptools
    # update setuptools
    $ sudo easy_install -U --script-dir /usr/local/bin setuptools
    $ sudo easy_install --prefix /usr/local \
        -f http://www.turbogears.org/download/index.html \
        "TurboGears[standard]==1.0.X"
    # for sqlite
    $ sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
    $ sudo easy_install pysqlite

(Replace ``X`` with the minor version number of the TurboGears release you want to install.)


Additional (Optional) Packages (All Versions)
---------------------------------------------

There are many other packages available for use with TurboGears. To install them on Ubuntu, just run::

    $ sudo apt-get install "package-name"

where "package-name" is the name of the package you want to install and is usually of the form ``python-<projectname>``. Alternatively, if you can't find a package for your distribution or want
the newest version of the software, you should use ``easy_install``::

    $ sudo easy_install --prefix /usr/local "package"


where "package" is the name of the software as listed on the Cheeseshop_.

Here are some additional packages you might be interested in.


Docutils
~~~~~~~~

You should probably get Docutils_, since it is used in some of the tutorials, and its support for ReStructuredText should be handy in whatever application you're going to build.


SQLAlchemy
~~~~~~~~~~

Another database object mapper, slated to become default in future versions of TurboGears.
You can get it from the universe repository, or via ``easy_install``. See
:doc:`SQLAlchemy </SQLAlchemy/index>` for more information.


Genshi
~~~~~~

Genshi is another template language, slated to become default in future versions of TurboGears.
For "Feisty" you can get it from the universe repository, for "Edgy" and "Dapper" use ``easy_install``.
See :doc:`GenshiTemplating </GenshiTemplating>` for more information.
