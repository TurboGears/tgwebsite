**Abstract**

   *This page describes how to install TurboGears when you do not have an
   Internet connection or are behind a firewall or proxy that prevents*
   ``ez_setup`` *or* ``easy_install`` *from working.*

Introduction
------------

If you are trying to install TurboGears and have unrestricted Internet
access, then the standard installation instructions can't be beat.
``easy_install`` is a real walk in the park!  But if you are behind a
restrictive firewall or proxy  that prevents TurboGears from installing
successfully, then you need another way to install it.  Or maybe you just
want to download the files once and then install TurboGears on several
different machines (via LAN or USB key or whatever).  The instructions
provided here will let you do that too.

Just follow the steps below and you'll be enjoying the wonders of
TurboGears in no time. :-)

Some Starting Assumptions
-------------------------

* Obviously you will have to have *some* internet connection to download the
  turbogears files once, but after that you can do all the installation
  without it.

* This page assumes that you already have Python.  If not please see the
  standard installation instructions for your platform
  (:doc:`Unix-like systems <Nix>`, :doc:`Windows <Windows>`, :doc:`Max OS X <Mac>`)
  for help on getting it.

* These instructions are provided in a platform-independent way.  It is
  assumed that you will know how to follow these steps on your chosen platform.

With that in mind, let's get on with the show!

Step 0: NTLM Authentication
---------------------------

Many corporate environments use Microsoft Proxy Server to restrict access
to the Internet.  It uses a proprietary protocol called NTLM for force
users to authenticate before they can access the Web.  If this is your
situation, you can use the following shortcut and skip the rest of
these instructions.  If not, you can skip this section.

The solution that is recommended in the `setuptools installation documentation`_
for dealing with this problem is to use the
`NTLM Authorization Proxy Server`_ (APS) to handle the NTLM
authentication.  Here is a quick run down on how to use it:

.. _setuptools installation documentation: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installing-easy-install
.. _NTLM Authorization Proxy Server: http://ntlmaps.sourceforge.net/

Once you `download`_ and extract APS, modify ``server.cfg``:

.. _download: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=69259

* In the ``[GENERAL]`` section set ``PARENT_PROXY`` and
  ``PARENT_PROXY_PORT`` to match the values in *Internet Explorer |
  Tools | Internet Options | Connections | LAN settings | Proxy
  settings*. Leave the ``LISTEN_PORT`` at 5865.

* In the ``[NTLM_AUTH]`` section, set the ``NT_DOMAIN`` to your domain,
  ``USER`` to your login ID and clear the ``PASSWORD`` field so you will
  be asked for it in the next step. (It is not advisable to save your
  password in this text file, for obvious reasons!)

Next, open a DOS command window and change to the folder where you
extracted APS and run ``runserver.bat``.  This should ask for your
password.

Now, open another DOS command window and redirect python through
your APS proxy, by typing::

   set HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:5865

Now you can follow the normal install instructions from in that second
command window.

Once you are done installing TurboGears, you can close the command window
where APS is running.

That's it!  You're done! :-)

Step 1: Setuptools
------------------

So if you are here, then you are lucky enough to not be behind a Microsoft
Proxy Server using NTLM authentication.  In which case please keep reading.

TurboGears is installed using the ``easy_install`` command.  It is part of
the *setuptools* package.  If you already have setuptools, you can skip
this section. If not, please read on.

The normal way of installing setuptools for the first time is to download
the ``ez_setup.py`` file and run it.  It will go out to the internet and
then download and install the setuptools package for you.  However if it
cannot connect to the internet (which is why you are reading this page),
the secret piece of information is that **you can download setuptools as a
regular python package** and install it using the tried and true::

   python setup.py install

Just head on over to the `setuptools Cheese Shop page`_ and download the zip
file.

.. _setuptools Cheese Shop page: http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/setuptools

Setuptools is generally thought of as the biggest barrier to installing
TurboGears without the internet because many people only know to use
``ez_setup.py`` as the installation option for it.  This is understandable
as that is the promoted and best way to install it.  But as you can see, it
is not the only way.  Thankfully!

Step 2: Downloading TurboGears
------------------------------

Now that we have setuptools downloaded and can install it, we need to get
TurboGears.

TurboGears depends on several other packages and so it has a lot of
dependencies.  This is a strength (code reuse), but in our case it can be
a minor annoyance too.

Step 2a: Using easy_install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a way to get unrestricted access to the internet, there is a
quick an easy way to just download all of TurboGears and all of it's
dependencies to a directory without installing it.  With setuptools
installed, make a directory and in it, run::

   easy_install -zmaxd . TurboGears

This will connect to the internet and just download TurboGears and all of
it's dependencies to the current directory, without installing anything.

   **Caveat:** The ``-a`` option, above, prevents development versions of
   packages from being downloaded.  Sometimes that is what is required.
   So if the above command fails, saying ``Could not find suitable
   distribution`` and ``(--always-copy skips system and development
   eggs)``, then you cannot use this shortcut and will have to download all
   the those files manually.

For a more complete explanation of ``-zmaxd``, run::

  easy_install --help

or check out the `setuptools command-line options documentation`_.

.. _setuptools command-line options documentation: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#command-line-options

  **Upgrading**: if you are trying to upgrade your TurboGears using this
  method, use ``-zmaxUd``.  The ``U`` tells setuptools to upgrade, if
  possible, over what is currently installed and/or what is currently in your
  download directory.

Step 2b: Manually Downloading Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your only access to the internet is restricted so that the above
shortcut does not work (or if it does not work for any other reason), you
can always download the files manually, one at a time, from the
`TurboGears download page`_, or from the `TurboGears downloads file list`_.
There are a lot of files there, so here is some explanation of them so you can
know which ones you need to care about, but first, a note about platforms,
Python versions and eggs:

.. _TurboGears download page: http://www.turbogears.org/1.0/downloads/current/index
.. _TurboGears downloads file list: http://www.turbogears.org/1.0/downloads/current

About Platforms, Python Versions and Eggs
`````````````````````````````````````````

Generally you want to download one egg file for each package.  Some
packages are platform-independant, meaning that they run on Windows, Mac
and unix-like systems without needing seperate versions.  Others packages,
however, have to be compiled for different platforms.  In this case,
precompiled Windows and Mac OS X version are provided.  So when choosing
your files, if the choice is offered, download files with the following in
their names:

* ``win32`` for Windows,
* ``macosx`` for Mac OS X, or
* ``tar.gz`` source files for Unix systems

For example:

* ``Cheetah-1.0-py2.4-macosx-10.4-ppc.egg`` is for Mac OS X,
* ``Cheetah-1.0-py2.4-win32.egg`` is for Windows, and
* ``Cheetah-1.0.tar.gz`` is the source code for Unix systems

Also you only need to choose packages that match your version of Python. So
look for:

* ``py2.4`` for Python 2.4 or
* ``py2.3`` for Python 2.3

Finally, egg files are generally preferred over zip or tar.gz files.


Step 3: Database Drivers
------------------------

We are almost done! :-)

While the TurboGears download page includes TurboGears and all of it's
dependencies, it does not include database driver packages. Which
driver(s) you need depend on which database(s) you want to use.  At a
minimum, you probably want to get the ``pysqlite`` package for use during
development and probably for use in unit tests too.

As is mentioned in the main TurboGears installation documentation, you can
find links to the various supported database driver libraries in the
`SQLObject documentation`_.

.. _SQLObject documentation: http://sqlobject.org/SQLObject.html#requirements

That's it!  You now have everything you need to install TurboGears without
an internet connection.  You can now take your laptop on the plane, copy
the files to a USB key and take it to work or whatever.  The only thing
left is how to actually install TurboGears! :-)

Step 4: Installing TurboGears
-----------------------------

Okay, so just to recap:

* We have setuptools that we can install the "old fashioned way",
* We have all the packages necessary to install TurboGears, and
* We have all the database driver packages we want.

So to actually do the installation, do the follwing:

* Install setuptools and the database drivers, each with::

   python setup.py install

* Then, in the directory where the TurboGears files are, run::

   easy_install -f . TurboGears

The ``-f .`` tells easy_install to use the current directory as the source
of the packages and not go looking on the internet.

You should also see if there are any extra options or steps to take for
your chosen platform by looking in the main installation instructions for
your platform.

After that, you should have a nice shiny new TurboGears installed and
waiting for you to create the next hottest site on the Web! :-D  Good Luck!
