Installing older versions of TurboGears
=======================================

.. contents::
  :depth: 2


Sometimes the latest and greatest just won't do. You need an old, perhaps rusty,
but stable and well tested version of TurboGears.


Installing a different version
------------------------------

If you run ``easy_install`` without arguments, it will get you the lastest version
(which is probably what you don't want), so you will have to specify the version via::

    easy_install PackageName==1.2.3

Remember that you need to specify a download URL for TurboGears installations or
easy_install will look for packages directly through the Cheeseshop_, where some
of the required packages can not be found.

.. _cheeseshop: http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi

For example if we are at 1.0.9 and you want to go back to 1.0.4.4,
on a Unix system you will have to run the following::

    sudo easy_install -i http://www.turbogears.org/1.0/downloads/1.0.4.4/index/ \
        --script-dir /usr/local/bin TurboGears==1.0.4.4

Just add the correct ==<version> to the end of the "normal command".


Installing directly from the SVN repository
-------------------------------------------

What if there are no eggs for my version? Then you will have to
either upgrade your code or install an SVN tagged version of
TurboGears with the following command::

  easy_install -f http://www.turbogears.org/1.0/downloads/current/index \
    http://svn.code.sf.net/p/turbogears1/code/tags/1.0.4.4

Replace the version number at the end of the second URL with the TurboGears
version you want.

This method requires that you have easy_install (from setuptools_) and
Subversion_ installed.

.. _subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/


Running from a Subversion working copy
--------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can run from the Subversion working copy directly:

#. Locate the revision number from http://trac.turbogears.org/turbogears/browser/tags.
#. Do a Subversion checkout or update to that revision number.
#. Change into the working copy directory and run::

    python setup.py develop


How to uninstall a SVN working copy
-----------------------------------

Go to your ``<prefix>/lib/site-package`` directory and look for a file called
``Turbogears.egg-link``. If you open it you will see taht it contains the path
of your svn working copy. Whatever is there, is what Python will think as your
"current TurboGears install".

#. delete ``Turbogears.egg-link`` from the ``site-packages`` directory.
#. you're done! :)


Moving between SVN revisions
----------------------------

Just update your Subversion working copy, setuptools will follow you.
