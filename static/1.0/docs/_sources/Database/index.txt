This page is give some hints on the database back-ends supported by SQLObject
and SQLAlchemy and how to install them on different operating systems.



Supported Database Backends

The process of installing a database system differs greatly from each database
and each operating system to another and therefore we can only refer you to
the documentation of the database system in question and give you some hints
below.

After you have installed a database system we need Python bindings for it,
that is a library that lets Python programs interact with the database backend.


Linux
-----

There are many ways to install software on Linux:

- Have a look whether there is a package in your distribution's package
  collection.
- If not, you can make your own package for it.
- Or look if the Python package is available from the Cheeseshop_ (PyPI)
  and ``easy_install`` it.
- As a last resort, build from source.

.. _cheeseshop: http://www.python.org/pypi

Which way to go depends on your prefenrences and your expertise, although for
most distributions it is prefered to manage all installed software through the
package management. ``easy_install`` is probably the easiest way, when there is
a binary egg for your system available.


MySQL
~~~~~

You will need the mysqldb_ module, which may be called ``mysql-python`` in
your distribution and it is also called like that in the PyPI.

.. _mysqldb: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python

Best Approach:

Use your package manager to install ``mysql-python``. If that fails:

- Install development tools (gcc, make, etc.).
- Install MySQL development tools.

::

    easy_install mysql-python



SQLite
~~~~~~

You will need the pysqlite_ modul.

.. _pysqlite: http://initd.org/tracker/pysqlite

Best Approach:

Use your package manager to install ``pysqlite``. If that fails:

- Install development tools (gcc, make, etc.).
- Install SQLite and the SQlite development files.

::

  easy_install pysqlite


PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~

You will need the `psycopg2`_ module if you're going to use Unicode, otherwise
either psycopg or psycopg2 will do it. We recommend using psycopg2 because of
other features besides unicode.

Best Approach:

Use your package manager. If that fails:

- Look for binaries at `the psycopg2 install page`_

- Build it yourself using the instructions on the above page.


.. _psycopg2: http://initd.org/tracker/psycopg/wiki/PsycopgTwo
.. _the psycopg2 install page:
    http://initd.org/tracker/psycopg/wiki/PsycopgTwoInstall


Windows
-------

On Windows there is basically one way to install packages, an exe file (aka
installer), provided by the package author or users. Installing from source is a
pain and should be your last resource. If you do choose to go this way you will
need VisualStudio or equivalent tools.

*TODO add link to MC visual C compiler*

.. warning::
    Setting up the tools to compile Python C-extension on Windows is not for the
    faint of heart.


MySQL
~~~~~

You will need `mysqldb`_, mysql-python is the name in in pypi.

Best Approach:

You can find an installer at in `MySQL-python download section`_ on Sourceforge.
Get the latest version and install it by double-clicking on the installer.

.. _MySQL-python download section:
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22307

If that fails:

- *TODO (If you get this working, post it here)*


SQLite
~~~~~~

For Python versions < 2.5, you will need pysqlite_. In Python >= 2.5, pysqlite
is already integrated as sqlite3_, but maybe an older version than the current
pysqlite. Make sure you have a recent version installed.

.. _sqlite3: http://docs.python.org/lib/module-sqlite3.html

Best Approach:

- easy_install pysqlite


PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~

- Download and install from here_.

Mac OS X
--------

The easiest way of installed most of the common open source databases on OS X is
to either use `MacPorts`_ or `Fink`_.

.. _MacPorts: http://www.macports.org/
.. _Fink: http://fink.sourceforge.net/

Both of these are package management systems that will install all the
dependencies for you.

To install Mac Ports, first install X11 and Xcode from Apple, and then install
the dmg from `MacPorts installation page`_ and follow the instructions on
the MacPorts site.

.. _macports installation page: http://www.macports.org/install.php
