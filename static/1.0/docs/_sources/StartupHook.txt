TurboGears has a ``call_on_startup`` and ``call_on_shutdown`` facility
in the ``turbogears.startup`` module:

It is used by putting code similar to the following in a file imported
when you application starts up, e.g. ``controllers.py`` or ``command.py``::

    from turbogears.startup import call_on_startup

    def do_your_thing():
        # do the thing syou want to do on startup here
        pass

    call_on_startup.append(do_your_thing)

You can name the callables you append to the ``call_on_*`` lists anything you like
and do anything you need there, e.g. insert filters into the CherryPy request phase
or set up variables as needed.
