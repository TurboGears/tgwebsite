Zeroconf support in TurboGears
==============================

.. contents:: Table of Contents
    :depth: 2


When a project is started in development mode, TurboGears automatically
announces its IP address and port number to the network. This is done
through Zeroconf_ (aka Apple Bonjour/Rendezvous), specifically the
*DNS Service Discovery* (DNS-SD) protocol. To disable DNS-SD announcements
(or enable it in production environments), use the ``tg.bonjour`` variable
in the configuration file.

.. note::
    There is a bug in TurboGears 1.0.x versions that prevents you from
    disabling Zeroconf (if it is available) in development mode, even if
    you set ``tg.bonjour`` to a false value. You can, however, enable it
    in production mode by setting ``tg.bonjour`` to the name under which
    your application should appear in the service list.

Mac OS X
--------

Service announcement works out of the box in Mac OS X (through the
``"/usr/bin/dns-sd"`` binary). To see the list of HTTP services published in
your network, open Safari and enable "Bonjour bookmarks" in the
"Bookmark preferences" tab.


Linux
-----

Zeroconf support for Linux depends on Avahi_, so make sure that you have
Avahi and its Gnome applet installed, e.g. on Ubuntu (Dapper and above)::

   apt-get install avahi-daemon service-discovery-applet

.. _avahi: http://avahi.org

After adding `sd-applet` to your Gnome Panel, make sure it has "Services -
_http._tcp" and "Advanced - Browse services published on this machine"
enabled in Preferences.


Windows
-------

TurboGears support for Zeroconf isn't available on Windows yet.
