*This is the verbose version of TurboGears quickstart guide*


Getting started
---------------

Your journey into the land of easy web application creation has begun. Take the following
steps to dive right in:


Design your model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Develop your model in the model.py file.

You can edit ``dev.cfg`` to use a different backend.

Or just start with pre-configured :doc:`SQLite <Database/SQLite>` database.

* :doc:`Learn more about designing models <GettingStarted/UseDatabase>`
* :doc:`Learn more about database backends <BackEndOverview>`

Run the command ``tg-admin sql create`` in your project directory to create the tables in
the database.


Create your views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create your views with html-like templates in the ``<project-package>/templates`` folder.

Static content (Javascript, CSS, images) should be located in the ``<project-package>/static``
folder.

* :doc:`Learn more about views <GettingStarted/Kid>`
* :doc:`Learn more about defining static content <StaticFiles>`


Build your controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edit ``<project-package>/controllers.py`` and build your website structure with the
simplicity of Python objects.

* :doc:`Learn more about controllers <GettingStarted/Controller>`


And more...
-----------

There are many other cool things you can do with TurboGears.
Please check out our :doc:`documentation <index>`.

TurboGears, when running in development mode, will automatically reload itself when
you modify your project, so all you need to do after saving your files is reloading
the page in your browser.
